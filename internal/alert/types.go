package alert

// The catalogue of everything a notification channel can subscribe to.
//
// ── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Until notification channels, nothing needed a LIST of alert types: each rule
// wrote its own display string into `Fired.AlertType` and `StoredType` derived
// the stored key at the moment it was recorded. That is fine for a producer and
// useless for a consumer — the channel modal has to render every event with a
// toggle beside it, and a modal cannot read Go string literals.
//
// So the list is written down once, here, and `internal/verify` checks it
// against the literals in the evaluator's source IN BOTH DIRECTIONS: a type a
// rule raises and this list omits is a toggle an operator never gets, and an
// entry here that no rule raises is a toggle that silently does nothing. Both
// are invisible without the ledger, because each half agrees with itself.
//
// `alertLabels` in format.go is NOT this. It is a three-entry override map for
// the two RouterOS-update spellings and "connectivity", consulted by `LabelFor`
// when a stored key reads badly; it has nothing to say about the other nine.
//
// ── THE KEY IS THE DOWN TYPE'S STORED FORM ─────────────────────────────────
//
// `StoredType("Ping Loss")` is `ping_loss`, which is also the `ResolveType` the
// "up" side carries, which is also what `alert_events.alert_type` holds and what
// `cooldownKey` builds on. One identity, already used by four things, so the
// catalogue adopts it rather than minting a parallel vocabulary.
type Type struct {
	// Key is the stored form of Down, and the value a channel subscribes to.
	Key string
	// Down and Up are the display strings the rules emit. Up is empty for an
	// event that has no recovery side.
	Down string
	Up   string
	// Label and Desc are what the channel modal shows.
	Label string
	Desc  string
	// Backup marks the two events that are not alerts: they come from
	// `(*Server).dispatchBackup`, not from the evaluator, and so are checked
	// against a different source by the ledger.
	Backup bool
	// Power marks the Power/UPS module's events (docs/inverter/PLAN.md). Like
	// the backup events they record no `alert_events` row - the module keeps
	// its own events, shown on its page - so their key is not a StoredType;
	// internal/power's NoticeKey is what raises them, and the ledger checks
	// them against it.
	Power bool
}

// types is the catalogue. Ordered for display rather than alphabetically: the
// events an operator is most likely to want are first.
