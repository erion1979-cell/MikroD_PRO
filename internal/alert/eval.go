// The alert evaluator's rules — the port of `createEvaluator`.
//
// ── EDGE DETECTION, NOT LEVEL DETECTION ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every rule compares a reading against a threshold AND against its own previous
// verdict, firing only on the TRANSITION. `system:update` arrives about every
// two seconds, so a rule that fired on the LEVEL would page the operator
// continuously while a CPU stayed busy. The alert-eval corpus pins it:
// `cpuGoesHighAndStaysHigh` fires once across four readings, and a level-testing
// port passes every other CPU case.
//
// ── WHAT IS HERE, AND WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT ──────────────────────────────
//
// Everything except the BGP family: the CPU rule, the RouterOS update check,
// ping loss, host reachability, interface up/down and VPN peers. BGP is not
// ported; the corpus records them as uncovered BY NAME, and its
// generator fails if a family appears in the live evaluator that is in neither
// list. A green suite here does not mean the evaluator is ported.
//
// ── AND NOTHING CALLS THIS YET, ON PURPOSE ──────────────────────────────────
//
// Wiring an evaluator to the notification transports is a CUTOVER step: both
// apps would evaluate the same conditions against the same routers, and the
// cooldown is an in-memory map rather than a shared row, so every alert would be
// sent twice. `internal/notify/send.go` carries the reasoning; the port record
// Part 25 records it.

// ── THE notif* GATES ARE GONE, AND SO IS `Settings` ───────────────────────
//
// It carried NotifCPU, NotifPing, NotifIfaceUpDown, IfaceTypeFilters and the
// rest: one boolean per alert type deciding whether that type was raised at
// all. Notification channels replaced them. Every alert is recorded now, and a
// channel's Events tab decides what is DELIVERED — see `emit`.
//
// NOTHING IS LEFT, AND `Settings` IS GONE WITH IT. The two thresholds were the
// last of it, and they are a property of the notification channel now: each one
// decides what IT is told about, and the evaluator records against a fixed floor
// without deciding for anybody. See `FloorCPU` below.

// Router is what the evaluator needs to know about the device.
//
// `ID` IS LOAD-BEARING: the live `fire` guards its whole record-and-emit block
// on `router && router.id`, so a router without one evaluates every rule and
// emits nothing. Not a hypothetical — the corpus generator hit exactly that, and
// every case read as "no alert fired" until the fixture gained an id.

	// ── WHY IT TRAVELS WITH THE ALERT ─────────────────────────────────────
	//
	// Thresholds are a property of the notification CHANNEL now, so the decision
	// "is this bad enough to tell you about" is made at delivery, per channel —
	// and the only way delivery can make it is if the number comes with the
	// alert. The evaluator records against a fixed floor and does not decide for
	// anybody.

	// IfaceType is ether/wlan/bridge/vlan/other for an alert about an interface,
	// and EMPTY for everything else.
	//
	// ── CLASSIFIED HERE, WHERE ROUTEROS'S OWN TYPE IS KNOWN ───────────────
	//
	// A notification channel can narrow Interface Up/Down to particular kinds of
	// interface, and that filter runs at DELIVERY, long after this row is built.
	// By then only the interface's NAME survives, and `IfaceType` falls back to
	// guessing from the name when it has no type — so a bridge called
	// "office-link" would be filtered as "other". The rule below has the real
	// `.type` from the router, so it decides once, here, and carries the answer.
	IfaceType string
	// Supersede resolves an alert of the SAME type and subject before filing
	// this one, instead of the dedup guard returning early because it is
	// already open. Only the RouterOS-update rule sets it — see below.
	Supersede bool
	// Vars are template variables of this alert's own, beside routerName,
	// timestamp, detail and subject: a Power/UPS alert carries the unit's
	// readings here. `alertType` cannot be overridden by one (alertdispatch.Build).
	Vars map[string]string
	// Silent means: show it, record it, do NOT notify.
	//
	// ── ONE PRODUCER, AND LIVE'S STRUCTURE IS THE REASON ──────────────────
	//
	// The supersede branch below emits a synthetic RESOLUTION for the alert being
	// replaced. In live that resolution goes out through `_emit` — the browser
	// and the Reports tab see it — and never reaches the delivery loop, because
	// `fire` runs the loop once for the alert it was called with and the
	// supersede resolution is not one of those calls.
	//
	// MEASURED by the alert-eval corpus once it began recording cooldown
	// keys: the update-supersede case emits THREE alerts and delivers TWO. A port
	// that notified on everything `Evaluate` returned would send an extra "up"
	// message every time a router's available version changed.

// family, fixed upstream the same day (`07da9a9`).
//
// ── AND THE OBVIOUS FIX IS BACKWARDS ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// `Map.set` on an EXISTING key does not move it, so insertion order is not

// still live, and it needs no notion of recency at all.
//
// ── STILL GATED ON THE BOUND, AND THAT IS NOT AN OPTIMISATION ──────────────
//
// Under stateMax this touches nothing, because A PAYLOAD IS NOT ALWAYS THE WHOLE
// FLEET: upstream, an `ifstatus:update` can carry a provisional snapshot
// mid-cycle, and pruning against a partial list would drop live state and
// recreate the very bug being fixed. Above the bound the risk is worth taking,
// because the alternative there is discarding all of it.

// ── FOR A PAYLOAD THAT CARRIES NO UPDATE INFORMATION AT ALL ───────────────
//
// `UpdateVerdict` conflates "not checked yet" with "up to date": with no
// `latest-version` and no `status` it returns false, and `updateRule` reads
// false as "the router reached the version" and RESOLVES an open alert.
//
// That is harmless in the live app, which shares one update result across every
// SystemCollector for a router. This port did not — `collect/system.go` says so
// outright: "This port builds ONE session per router, so the schedule lives on
// the collector. A second session type would need the shared map back."
// `internal/alertpool` WAS that second session type, and its collector had
// usually never run the check, so its payloads said "no update" and closed the
// alert the session's collector had just opened. MEASURED: 50 fire/resolve pairs
// in 24 hours against zero in the live app.
//
// ── THE SECOND SESSION TYPE IS GONE, AND THIS SPLIT STAYS ─────────────────
//
// The alert pool was deleted on 2026-09-09: every router nobody is watching is
// held by `session.Manager` now, so the premise above — two collectors for one
// router, disagreeing about the update check — cannot arise from that source.
//
// THAT IS NOT A REASON TO FOLD THIS BACK IN. The defect is in `UpdateVerdict`
// conflating "not checked" with "up to date", and it fires for ANY payload that
// carries no update information: a primed reading, a first tick before the
// check has run, a collector whose check failed. Removing the split would make
// the app correct only for as long as exactly one collector per router ever
// produces a `system:update` payload, and nothing enforces that. Kept, with the
// premise updated rather than the guard removed.
//
// ── WHY A SEPARATE METHOD RATHER THAN A FLAG ──────────────────────────────
//
// `SystemUpdate` is gated against the live evaluator by
// The alert-eval corpus. Adding an argument live does not have would make
// every case in that corpus a port-specific shape. This is a port-specific
// SPLIT, so the port-specific decision lives in `internal/alertwire`, which
// chooses between the two — and the rule this file gates stays exactly live's.
