//
// ── THE CONFIG IS SEALED WHOLE ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `notify_channels.config` holds `{"sealed":"<ciphertext>"}`, the wrapper
// `ztp_devices.values_json` already uses. Sealing the whole object rather than
// picking out secret fields is the right shape here because for a webhook
// channel there is nothing that is NOT secret: `tgram://<token>/<chat>` carries
// its credential in the path, so "the URL" and "the secret" are one string.
//
// ── AND THE ASYMMETRY IS DELIBERATE ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A failed decrypt costs that one channel, which then has no destination and is
// skipped. A missing store on ENCRYPT refuses the save outright rather than
// writing a credential in the clear. Both copied from `usernotify_api.go`, where
// the reasoning is written out in full.
