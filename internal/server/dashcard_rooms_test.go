// EVERY CARD ROOM A BROWSER JOINS MUST BE A ROOM SOMETHING EMITS TO.
//
// ── THE DEFECT ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A card's room KEY comes from `CARD_ROOMS`, lifted verbatim from live's
// dashboard-grid.js, and two of its keys do not name their own room:
// `dc-card-physports` uses the key `interfaces` and `card-network` uses `dhcp`,
// while the collectors emit to `dash-card-physports` and `dash-card-network`.
// Joining `dash-card-` + key subscribed the browser to a room nothing ever sent
// to — silently, because an empty room is indistinguishable from a quiet one.
//
// The visible symptom was the operator's: dashboard cards with no data. It hid
// behind the connect-time replay, which paints the card once if the collector
// happens to have produced already — so the fast collector's card looked fine
// and the ten-minute one's did not.
//
// ── WHY THIS IS A SOURCE PIN ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The property is a JOIN matching an EMIT, across two files and a generated
// table. No request exercises it: the browser subscribes, the server accepts,
// and nothing fails — the card simply never updates.
