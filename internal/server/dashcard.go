// Dashboard card rooms.
//
// A card on the Dashboard can be the ONLY view a collector gets. Someone whose
// dashboard shows the Firewall card but who never opens the Firewall page still
// needs that collector running, so a card joins a room of its own and wakes the
// same collectors the page would.
//
// ── TWO PAGES ARE CHECKED, NOT ONE ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A card needs the DASHBOARD and the page it borrows its data from. Streaming
// firewall detail through a dashboard card to someone denied the Firewall page
// would make the whole permission matrix a lie — and it is the first thing an
// operator checks. Both are required before the room is joined, and the join and
// the replay are gated together: gating only the join would still hand the
// caller a payload they may not see.
//
// ── THE KEY IS VALIDATED, NOT ESCAPED ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// It becomes part of a room name, and room names are how payloads are addressed.
// A key outside `[a-z]{2,20}` is refused outright rather than sanitised, because
// there is no such thing as a card whose name needed cleaning up.

// "checked against the live resolution by the grid table generator" — a
// generator that is not in `tools/` and has not run since the cutover, so the
// check it named had quietly stopped existing.

// `internal/dashcards` is the one declaration now, `cmd/gridgen` emits the

	//
	// The grid sends `dashcard:focus` as soon as it lays out, which is BEFORE
	// the client has sent `router:select`. This returned early on an empty
	// routerID, so every subscription was dropped in silence and three dashboard
	// cards — Connections, Network, Physical Ports — never received their
	// payload. Measured 2026-08-29 after the operator reported cards with no
	// data: the browser sends the frames, the server discards them, and sending
	// the identical frames AFTER a select delivers all three.
	//
	// The live app cannot have this. `socket.routerId` is set while the
	// connection is being established, so by the time any client frame arrives a
	// router is already known; `router:select` is this port's own arrangement.
	//
	// So the request is recorded whatever the order, and `selectRouter` replays
	// it. Recording rather than rejecting is also what makes a router SWITCH
	// keep the cards subscribed — the rooms are per router, so they have to be
	// rejoined against the new one anyway.
