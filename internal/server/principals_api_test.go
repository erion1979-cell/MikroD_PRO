	//
	// Wifi Map was a fourth from PR #134 until it gained `pageWifiMap`; the count
	// went back to three, so a page added without a toggle fails here again.
	//
	// FOUR SINCE THE AI AGENT (#98), and for a different reason from the other
	// three. Dashboard, Reports and Settings cannot be hidden at all. The AI
	// Agent CAN be, and is — by `aiReady`, derived from the AI tab: enabled, with
	// an endpoint and a model. A `pageAiAgent` toggle beside it would be a second
	// switch for one page, and the Visible Pages presets walk that same table
	// writing to `el('s_' + key)` across the whole document, so the Advanced
	// preset would have found the enable toggle in the AI tab and switched the
	// assistant on as a side effect of choosing a nav layout.
	// FIVE SINCE THE FIRST GENERATED PAGE (slice 5 of the MikroMCP parity work).
	// An area's visibility is not a settings key of its own: one `hiddenAreas`
	// list covers every area, which is the whole point — forty areas would
	// otherwise be forty keys, forty corpus re-aims and forty rows in the
	// Visible Pages grid. `ip-pools` is the first.
	//
	// COUNTED APART SINCE 2026-09-18, when IP Addresses became the second area and
	// this number would have moved again — as it would for every area after it.
	// Areas are held to "no toggle" one by one above; the rest are counted here.
	//
	// FIVE SINCE THE TOOLS PAGE (slice 8), by the operator's choice on 2026-09-18.
	// It runs nothing until somebody starts a tool, so hiding it is a question of
	// who may run diagnostics — the permission matrix — and not of router load,
	// which is what the Visible Pages toggles exist to answer.
	//
	// SIX SINCE THE SECURITY SCAN (2026-09-19), for the Tools page's reason: it
	// reads nothing until it is opened, so who sees it is the permission
	// matrix's question (admins only by default), not router load's.
	//
	// SEVEN SINCE CONFIG MANAGEMENT (2026-09-21), for the same reason again: it
	// reads nothing from any router until it is opened and asked, and every
	// change it can make is an administrator's, so who sees it is the
	// permission matrix's question, not router load's.
	// EIGHT SINCE THE TERMINAL (2026-09-27), and it is the strongest case of the
	// lot. It touches a device only when somebody types a line, so there is no
	// load for a Visible Pages toggle to answer; and who may type one is as
	// squarely a permissions question as this app has.
	//
	// It briefly had an install-wide switch as well, and that is gone: the page
	// key IS the permission key, so the grant already answered the question and
	// the switch was a second mechanism for the one job. A `pageTerminal` toggle
	// would be a third, and a dangerous one — the Visible Pages presets walk
	// that table writing to `el('s_' + key)` across the whole document, so the
	// Advanced preset would have switched the terminal on for somebody who only
	// chose a nav layout.
	// ELEVEN SINCE TOOLS BECAME FOUR PAGES (2026-09-27), and the count moved by
	// three rather than by four: `tools` left the catalogue and `tools-ping`,
	// `tools-traceroute`, `tools-torch` and `tools-btest` joined it.
	//
	// THE REASON IS THE TOOLS PAGE'S, FOUR TIMES, and it did not change when the
	// page did: each one runs nothing until somebody starts it, so hiding it is
	// a question of who may run that diagnostic — the permission matrix — and
	// not of router load, which is what the Visible Pages toggles exist to
	// answer. What the split DID change is that the question is now asked four
	// times instead of once: a role can be given Traceroute and refused the
	// bandwidth test, which one `tools` key could never express.
	//
	// Four `pageToolsPing`-style toggles would be worse than one was. They would
	// be a second mechanism beside the four grants, and the Visible Pages
	// presets walk that table writing to `el('s_' + key)` across the whole
	// document — the trap the Terminal paragraph above records.
	// TWELVE SINCE THE PACKET SNIFFER (2026-09-27), and it is the four tool
	// pages' reason once more rather than a new one: it captures nothing until
	// somebody presses Start, so hiding it is a question of who may run it -
	// the permission matrix - and not of router load.
	//
	// A `pageSniffer` toggle would be worse here than anywhere. The page has a
	// SECOND gate this app does not own: /system/device-mode's `sniffer` flag,
	// which the device decides and the reset button changes. Three mechanisms
	// for one question, two of them ours, is how an operator ends up unable to
	// work out why a page is not there.
