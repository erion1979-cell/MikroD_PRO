	// closed, for every router that had ever been acquired.
	//
	// It was invisible for the same reason it was survivable — the reads fail
	// quietly and nobody is listening to the payloads — so the cost was a
	// growing pile of timers and a log nobody reads, rather than a symptom.

		// protocol error, a parse error or a read error sets `fatal`, this loop
		// redials -- and the previous connection is still established, still
		// logged in, and now unreachable: an fd, two Async goroutines, and a
		// `/user/active` entry the router has no reason to reap.
		//
		// UNCONDITIONAL, AND ON BOTH PATHS, because of a race with `idleOut`:
		// it captures `c := s.client` under the lock, so if the line above has
		// already nil'd it, idleOut closes nothing and the client is orphaned
		// even on a clean teardown. Whoever gets there first wins; `Close` is
		// idempotent (internal/routeros/client.go:386 guards on `c.closed`), so
		// closing twice is a no-op rather than an error.

// would go Offline the moment a viewer selected one. Hence a function rather
