// Package alertwire joins the three pieces that have existed separately for
// most of this port: the RULES (`internal/alert`), the HISTORY
// (`internal/db`'s alert writes) and the collector payloads that feed them.
//
// ── WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// IT DOES NOT DISPATCH. No Telegram message, no email, no ntfy push. That is
// step 2 of the plan in `LOOP.md`, and the switch is the operator's, for the
// reason cutover blocker 5 gives — the one blocker whose reasoning did
// NOT change when the port went standalone:
//
//	Both engines evaluate the same conditions against the same physical
//	routers, and the cooldown is an in-memory map rather than a shared row, so
//	neither sees the other's sends. A duplicated Telegram message or email
//	cannot be un-received.
//
// Everything here writes to THIS install's own database and nowhere else. Two
// engines filing a row twice is a duplicate an operator can delete; two engines
// sending an alert twice is not.
//
// ── ONE EVALUATOR PER ROUTER, KEYED AND DROPPABLE ──────────────────────────
//
// The rules are edge-detecting: they fire when a value CROSSES a threshold, not
// while it sits past one, so each router needs its own memory of what it last
// saw. The live app keeps `_evaluators` as a `routerId → evaluator` map and
// drops entries on a router switch or an idle teardown — and its own comment
// records what that costs: a rebuilt evaluator has no memory of having reported
// a thing, so it reports it again.
//
// That is exactly why `HasOpenAlert` asks the DATABASE rather than the
// evaluator. The dedup survives a drop; the edge state does not, and need not.
