// Package dashcards is the one list of the Dashboard's cards.
//
// ── WHY IT EXISTS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// One fact — what a dashboard card IS — was written down in five places across
// two languages: `DEFAULT_LAYOUT`, `CARD_LABELS` and `CARD_ROOMS` in
// `web/src/gen/grid-tables.ts`, and `dashCardPages` and `dashCardRooms` in
// `internal/server/dashcard.go`.
//
// The thing that kept them honest is gone. That generated file names a JavaScript
// generator under tools/ that is NOT IN THE REPOSITORY, and whose name does not
// even match the glob `tools/verify.sh` uses to find the generators it checks. So
// nothing has checked it since the cutover — and `dashCardPages`'s own comment
// still said it was "checked against the live resolution by the grid table
// generator", which had stopped being true without anything failing.
//
// (The generator's filename is deliberately not written here as a path. The
// citation check in internal/verify scans for one and cannot tell a location
// from the name of something absent, so spelling it would make this file fail a
// check by explaining why a file is missing.)
//
// This is the same problem `internal/pages` solves for pages, and it gets the
// same answer: one declaration in Go, a generator that emits the TypeScript, and
// `-check` in the build.
//
// ── ONE ROW PER CARD, SO THE HALVES CANNOT DISAGREE ─────────────────────────
//
// A card in the layout with no label, or naming a room nothing emits to, or
// borrowing from a page that does not exist, becomes impossible to express
// rather than something a dead generator used to catch.

// It is bumped only on a breaking change to the stored card-object format.
// ADDING A CARD IS NOT THAT: `mergeLayout` iterates the default layout and fills
// in any card a stored layout lacks, so a new card reaches existing users at its
// default position without touching this.

// Card is one dashboard card: where it sits, what it is called, and what feeds

type Card struct {
	// ID is the markup id, hyphenated: `dc-card-logs`.

	// Label is what the Add panel calls it.
	Label string
	// Room is the card's room KEY, or empty for a card no collector feeds.
	//
	// LETTERS ONLY, 2 to 20. It becomes part of a room name, and
	// `dashCardKeyRe` refuses anything else — silently, by returning early, so a
	// bad key is a card that never subscribes with nothing said.
	Room string
	// Emits is the room collectors actually send to, when it differs from Room.
	//
	// TWO CARDS NEED THIS and the mismatch is inherited: `dc-card-physports` has
	// the key `interfaces` while its collector emits to `dash-card-physports`,
	// and `card-network` has `dhcp` against `dash-card-network`. Joining
	// `dash-card-` + key would subscribe a browser to a room nothing ever sends
	// to, which is indistinguishable from a quiet one.
	Emits string
	// Page is the page this card borrows its data from, and therefore the second
	// permission checked before its room is joined.
	//
	// A card showing firewall detail to somebody denied the Firewall page would
	// make the whole permission matrix a lie. Empty means the card is gated on
	// the Dashboard alone, which is right only for a card whose data is not any
	// page's to withhold.
