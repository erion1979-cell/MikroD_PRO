// Package alertdispatch decides WHETHER an alert notification is sent, and what
// it says. It is step 2 of the plan in `LOOP.md`.
//
// ── IT IS OFF UNLESS SWITCHED ON, AND THAT IS NOT A DEFAULT-CHOICE ─────────
//
// `New` takes `enabled bool` and the server passes false unless the operator
// asks. cutover blocker 5 is the reason, and it is the one blocker whose
// reasoning did not change when the port went standalone:
//
//	Both engines evaluate the same conditions against the same physical
//	routers, and the cooldown is an in-memory map rather than a shared row, so
//	neither sees the other's sends. A duplicated Telegram message or email
//	cannot be un-received.
//
// A row filed twice is a duplicate an operator deletes. A message sent twice is
// already in their pocket. So the code exists, is tested, and is inert.
//
// ── THE GUARD ORDER IS CHANNEL, THEN COOLDOWN ──────────────────────────────
//
// And the cooldown is CONSUMED ONLY WHERE A SEND HAPPENS. The live comment says
// why: "a recipient who enables a channel later does not find a warm cooldown
// stamped while they had none." Reordering these is invisible in every test that
// only sends to a configured recipient, and shows up the first time someone
// turns a channel on.
