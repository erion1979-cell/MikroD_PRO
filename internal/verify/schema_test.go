// TestFixtureSchemasMatchReality: no Go test may create a table looser than the
// real one.
//
// ── THREE BUGS IN ONE DAY, ALL THIS SHAPE ───────────────────────────────────
//
// A test creates its own tables. If that DDL is looser than the database's, the
// code under test is checked against a database THAT CANNOT EXIST -- and it
// passes, while the code cannot read a real row. On 2026-08-26 it happened three
// times running. `sites.description` is NULLABLE; a fixture declared it
// `NOT NULL DEFAULT ”`, so `GetSite` scanning into a Go `string` passed the test
// and would have answered 500 for any site without a description, which is most
// of them.
//
// ── THE AUTHORITY IS THE REAL DDL, AND IT USED TO BE A FROZEN COPY ──────────
//
// This read `internal/verify/testdata/schema.sql`, on a premise stated in full
// at the time: "This was meant to be rewritten to compare fixtures against Go's
// own migrations. THERE ARE NONE. `internal/db` opens an existing database and
// refuses one below `MinSchema`; nothing in this repository creates a table
// outside a test." It ended "If Go ever grows migrations, this should read them
// instead."
//
// Go grew both. `internal/db/schema_ddl.go` builds a fresh database and
// `portMigrations` moves an old one, so the frozen file became a hand-kept copy
// of something the code already states - and it had already drifted FOUR TABLES
// behind without anything failing, because this check only ever compared
// FIXTURES against it. A premise that has expired reads exactly like one that is
// true.
//
// So it reads the real thing now, and `testdata/schema.sql` is gone. The parse
// is the same: `freshSchemaDDL` and the table constants it concatenates are
// plain CREATE TABLE text in Go raw strings.

	// read looks like a test's own scratch table.
	//
	// So the list is checked against the source rather than trusted. Every table
	// declared anywhere in internal/db must be one this test read. A file that is
