// THE ALERT CATALOGUE AGAINST THE RULES THAT RAISE THE ALERTS.
//
// ── WHY A LEDGER AND NOT A ROUND TRIP ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// `alert.Types()` exists so the notification-channel modal can draw a toggle per
// event. Nothing else consumes it, so nothing else notices when it drifts: a
// rule that starts raising a new alert type simply has no toggle, and every
// channel silently fails to subscribe to it. The reverse is quieter still - an
// entry for a type no rule raises renders a toggle that can never fire.
//
// A round-trip test cannot see either, because the catalogue agrees with itself
// whatever it contains. So this reads the EVALUATOR'S SOURCE, which is where the
// types actually live as string literals, and fails in both directions.
//
// ── WHAT IT READS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `AlertType: "..."` in internal/alert/eval.go and routerstatus.go. `emit` also
// re-emits `AlertType: f.AlertType` for the supersede path, which is a variable
// rather than a literal and so never matches - correct, because that path raises
// no NEW type.
//
// The two backup events are not in the evaluator at all: they are raised by
// `cfg.Notify(kind, ...)` in internal/backups/runfor.go. They are checked
// against that file instead, for the same reason and in the same two directions.
