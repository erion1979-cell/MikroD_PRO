// The DAILY RETENTION SWEEP — `prune()` and `startPruneInterval` in `src/db.js`.
//
// ── THE PORT HAD NONE, AND THE SETTINGS PAGE SAID OTHERWISE ────────────────
//
// `dbRetentionDays`, `dbAlertRetentionDays` and `dbAuditRetentionDays` are
// rendered by the Settings page, validated by the write route and persisted —
// and until 2026-08-29 nothing in this port ever read one. An operator could set
// a retention policy that did nothing while the database grew without bound.
//
// The third instance in two days of one shape: a setting rendered, validated,
// persisted, never consumed. The other two were the operator's own reports
// (`topN`, and `topTalkersN` beside it). This one was found by counting the
// class out of the generated settings table rather than waiting to be told.
//
// ── IT IS NOT `purge.go` ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `purge.go` is the operator-triggered cleanup card: it deletes by ROUTER, on
// demand, and deliberately excludes `audit_events`. This deletes by AGE, on a
// timer, across the whole install — and `audit_events` is in it, because age is
// the only thing allowed to remove an audit row.
//
// ── THE MAPPING IS LIFTED, NOT RETYPED ────────────────────────────────────
//
// The db-prune corpus reads the six DELETEs and three cutoffs out of the
// live `prune()`, and `prune_test.go` asserts this file against them. A seventh
// rule and a fourth policy have since been added for a table live never had;
// they are marked `portAdded` and held by their own ledger, so the recording
// keeps answering the one question it can. Two of the
// six are exactly the sort a retyped table gets wrong:
//
//   - `alert_events` keys on `fired_at`. The other five use `ts`.
//   - `connectivity_events` ages on the ALERT retention despite its column being
//     `ts` like the metrics. Aging it with the metrics would throw away a year
//     of connectivity history under a 90-day metric policy — and that is the
//     table the Reports page's outage view is drawn from.
//
// ── ZERO MEANS "DEFAULT", NOT "KEEP NOTHING" ──────────────────────────────
//
// The live cutoffs are `(retentionDays || 90) * 86400000`. A missing OR ZERO
// setting takes the default, so a settings file that has never had the field
// written keeps 90 days rather than deleting everything. Reproduced exactly:
// this is a delete path, and getting it backwards is unrecoverable.

// audit trail answers "who changed what" a year later; a chat thread from March
// answers nothing in September.

//
// It is not a retention policy an operator has a view about: it is the point
// where one resolution hands over to another, largely invisible because
// `fromHourly` moves the READ with it. A setting here would be a knob whose
// only honest description is "how much disk to spend on detail nobody can see",
// and this repository already carries scars from settings that are rendered and
// never read. If a reason to vary it appears, it becomes one deliberately.

// ── FOURTEEN WAS QUESTIONED AND KEPT, 2026-09-23 ───────────────────────────
//
// The number was chosen writing the plan, not measured, so it was re-examined
// against the strongest case for a longer window: MONTHLY is a first-class
// period here — report schedules have a monthly frequency and `aggBucket` has a
// month — and under fourteen days a report covering last calendar month is
// entirely hour-sourced, so its p95 is an approximation of the p95 over minutes
// and its volume peak is an hour rather than a minute. Thirty-five days would
// have made that report exact, at ~13.5 MB per recorded interface against
// ~5.4 MB.
//
// The operator's call was to keep fourteen. Recorded because the argument is a
// good one and will occur to the next reader too; what it costs is written down
// here rather than left to be rediscovered.
