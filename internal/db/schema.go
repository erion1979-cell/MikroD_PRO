	// MUST BE SAFE TO RUN TWICE, because a database built by `freshSchemaDDL`
	// already has the final shape and the migration tests replay from an old
	// stamp over exactly that. A copy referencing `perm_kind` fails to prepare
	// against the new table, and `map[int][]string` cannot express "only if
	// that column exists".
	//
	// So it rebuilds. The cost is the rows, and the reason that is acceptable
	// is specific rather than general: credential profiles had not shipped when
	// this was written - no tag, no push - so the only rows anywhere were test
	// data, and a profile carries nothing a router needs. A profile WITH links
	// would be a different question, because its link rows are MikroDash's only
	// record of accounts it put on devices; those were empty too.
	//
	// THIS REASONING DOES NOT TRANSFER. Once a version ships, the answer is the
	// awkward conversion, or a Go-level migration step that can ask what shape
	// it is looking at.

// long before this app existed — rather than on the whole sentence, which also
// names the column.
