/**
 * The Interfaces modal's traffic history panel (#59).
 *
 * ── THE FAILURE THIS FILE IS ABOUT ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * An interface nobody chose to record has no rows, and an interface that is
 * recorded but idle has no rows either. Drawn the same way, the first reads as
 * a fault: the operator goes looking for a broken collector instead of a switch
 * that was never turned on. So the panel has to SAY which one it is.
 *
 * ── AND IT MUST RENDER FOR A READ-ONLY VIEWER ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * The dialog used to skip its extras slot entirely when the form was read-only.
 * Reading history is a read, so each extra now decides for itself - but the
 * switch inside this one is a WRITE, and that stays behind `mayRecord`, which
 * the server answers rather than the browser guessing.
 *
 * ── IT GOES THROUGH THE REAL DIALOG ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The panel is reached by opening the resource dialog, not by calling the
 * panel. A panel registered under the wrong resource key, or a dialog that went
 * back to skipping read-only extras, fails here; a direct call to `render`
 * would pass in both cases.
