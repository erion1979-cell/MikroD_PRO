// Settings → Visible Pages applies and detects them, and a role's page matrix
// applies them. They were built in three places from the frozen VIEW_PRESETS and
// PAGE_NAV_MAP, which name only the hand-built pages that have a Visible Pages
// toggle. So every generated page, Tools and the AI Agent were in no preset:
// Advanced left them untouched on Visible Pages, and a role given Advanced got
// no access to any of them (found 2026-09-18).
//
// ── WHERE A PAGE'S TIER COMES FROM ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// - a hand-built page with a toggle: the frozen VIEW_PRESETS, and Advanced for
//   the rest of PAGE_NAV_MAP, as before;
// - a generated page: its `tier`, declared beside it in internal/areas;
// - a hand-built page with NO toggle: HAND_TIERS below. They matter to roles,
//   which grant every page, and not to Visible Pages, which has no box for them.
//
// A tier includes the tiers below it: Standard is Home and more.
