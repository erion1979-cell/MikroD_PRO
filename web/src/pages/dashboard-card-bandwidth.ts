// ── IT IGNORES `ifName`, DELIBERATELY ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// The traffic chart above it only accepts samples for the interface it is
// showing; this card accepts every one. `traffic.js` emits per-socket for the
// DEFAULT interface, so what arrives is already the WAN - filtering again here
// would drop the card's only input on a router whose default interface is not
// the one the chart is displaying.
//
// ── CAPACITY IS REMEMBERED, NOT RESET ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// `syncCapacity` updates only when the active router is FOUND in the list. A
// switch to a router that is not there yet - the id arrives before the list on a
// cold connect - keeps the PREVIOUS router's capacity rather than falling back
// to the 1000/1000 default. The bars are briefly scaled against the wrong
// router, and then correct themselves when the list lands. Reproduced: the
// alternative reads as "capacity unknown" and would make every bar jump on every
// switch.
//
// ── A RATE BELOW 1% IS `<1%`, AND ZERO IS AN EM DASH ────────────────────────
//
// Three states, not two: idle says nothing at all, a trickle says `<1%` rather
// than rounding to `0%` and looking idle, and everything else rounds.

 * the card unable to resolve ANY router's capacity. It came back only on

 * and a reorder, and never on connect. Since a switch happens at boot, the card
 * spent every session measuring against the 1000 Mbps default: an operator with
 * 50 Mbps upload saw their traffic scaled against a gigabit, and it appeared to
 * fix itself after any device edit.
 *
 * So only the DERIVED figures reset here, and they are immediately re-derived
 * for whichever router is now selected. A router with nothing recorded still
 * falls back to 1000, which is what the reset was for.
