// The Dashboard's System card: uptime, the three gauges, the meta line, the
// temperature and the RouterOS update row.
//
// ── THE CARD IS COALESCED, NOT THROTTLED ────────────────────────────────────
//
// `system:update` arrives about once a second. Every payload is STORED and a
// single animation frame is booked to render whichever one is latest - so a
// burst costs one layout rather than one per payload, and no payload is ever
// the reason a later one is dropped.
//
// A hidden tab renders NOTHING and keeps the data pending. That is the half
// that is easy to get wrong: skipping the render is obvious, but discarding the
// payload with it would leave the card showing stale numbers until the next
// tick after the tab came back. `flushPendingSystem` is what the visibility
// handler calls to settle it.
//
// ── THE META LINE IS WRITTEN ONCE ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Board name, RouterOS version, CPU count and RAM do not change while a router
// is connected, so they are written on the first payload that carries any of
// them and never again. `resetSysMeta` re-arms it, and both callers matter: a
// reconnect, and a switch to another router - whose board is a different board.
//
// ── AND THE ORDER OF THE LAST TWO IS LOAD-BEARING ───────────────────────────
//
// `sysMetaTemp` is a CHILD of `sysMeta`, created lazily on the first
// temperature and updated in place after. Rewriting the meta line therefore
// destroys it, and the lookup happens AFTER that rewrite so the next
// temperature recreates it. Hoisting the lookup would leave a detached node
// being updated forever, and the temperature would disappear on router switch
// and never come back.

/**
 * What the System card publishes on `mikrodash:updateavailable`.
 *
 * ── DECLARED ONCE, ON PURPOSE ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The Upgrade dialog reads this out of `CustomEvent.detail`, which is `any`, and
 * casts it. So the compiler cannot check the seam: the two modules could drift
 * to different shapes and nothing would say so until the dialog showed a dash
 * where a version belongs. They had two separate declarations that happened to
 * agree - the same setup that let `GeoPlace` and `City` disagree about an
 * optional field earlier in this port, where the compiler DID catch it because
 * the value did not pass through an `any`.
 *
 * Exporting it from the producer and importing it in the consumer at least makes
 * both sides name one type; the update-seam check covers what the
 * compiler still cannot.
