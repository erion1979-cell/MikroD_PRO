/**
 * Settings → the routers table, and the way into the router modal.
 *
 * ── THIS IS THE MODAL'S ONLY OPENER, WHICH IS WHY IT MATTERS ────────────────
 *
 * `router-modal.ts` and `router-form.ts` have been fully ported and completely
 * unreachable: the Devices page has no edit affordance of its own, so wiring the
 * modal from there put a dialog on a page with no way to open it. The Edit
 * button in these rows is the live app's opener, and this module is what makes
 * two already-tested files reachable.
 *
 * ── THE ROW IS A STRING, AND THE BUTTONS CARRY THEIR OWN ARGUMENTS ──────────
 *
 * `data-rtr-id`, `data-rtr-action` and `data-rtr-label` - one delegated listener
 * on the tbody rather than a handler per row, so a re-render does not leak
 * listeners. `data-rtr-label` exists ONLY for the delete confirmation, which
 * names the router being destroyed; reading the label out of the row's DOM
 * instead would break the moment the first cell's markup changed.
 *
 * ── THE ACTIVE ROUTER CANNOT BE DISABLED ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Its toggle is rendered `disabled` with a title saying why. That is a UI
 * courtesy, not the enforcement - the server decides - but it is the difference
 * between a button that explains itself and one that fails.

/**
 * Repaint ONE badge in place, on `router:status`.
 *
 * ── WHY IN PLACE AND NOT A RE-RENDER ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A status event arrives per router and can arrive often. Re-rendering the whole
 * tbody would rebuild every row and, more to the point, would throw away any
 * text selection or focus inside the table. The live app updates the one badge;
 * `data-rtr-conn` carries the router id for exactly this lookup, and porting the
 * attribute without this reader is what left the port rendering it and reading
 * nothing - the attr audit is what said so.
 *
 * ── IT DOES NOT PAINT A DISABLED ROW ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The disabled badge carries `data-rtr-conn` too, so an unguarded selector
 * matched it and replaced "Disabled" with "Offline" - or worse, "Online" -
 * leaving a dimmed row with an Enable button and an Online badge until the next
 * full render put it back. A disabled router still has its session torn down and
 * re-established around a switch, and `router:status` is emitted per router
 * rather than only for enabled ones, so it fires in ordinary use.
 *
 * This was reproduced deliberately for two days and reported in
 * ../MikroDash/ToDo.md rather than quietly fixed, because a port that differed
 * from the app it replaces is the worse failure. Upstream fixed it in `d7529e0`
 * and this follows.
 *
 * RECORDING AND PAINTING ARE SEPARATE, which is the point. `main.ts` writes
 * `routerStatus[id]` before calling this, so re-enabling the router re-renders
 * from that map and shows the state it actually had rather than a dash.
 *
 * AN UNKNOWN ROUTER IS NOT PAINTED EITHER, matching the live expression
 * `(_r && !_r.disabled)`: a `find` that misses yields undefined, and the guard
 * is falsy, so nothing is written.
