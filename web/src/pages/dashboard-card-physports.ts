// Dashboard card 3 - PHYSICAL PORTS (`ifstatus:update`).
//
// A row of RJ-45 drawings, one per physical port, coloured by state. It is a
// near-copy of the Interfaces page's Ports panel and the live repo has just
// finished repairing the ways that copy had drifted, so the differences that
// REMAIN are the ones to reproduce exactly:
//
//   - The FILTER is wider here: ether, sfp and sfp-sfpplus, where the panel
//     takes ether alone. A router whose uplink is an SFP cage shows it on the
//     dashboard and not on the Interfaces panel.
//   - The LABEL uses dcEsc; the panel uses esc. Both are correct in text
//     position and they differ on quotes, so an interface named qt"test renders
//     as different innerHTML in the two places while displaying the same text.
//     Not a defect, and not unified - a port reproduces what is there.
//
// THE TITLE USES esc, AND THAT ONE WAS A DEFECT until 2026-08-24 (ToDo #16).
// It lands in an ATTRIBUTE, where dcEsc is wrong: dcEsc round-trips through a
// text node, which is the browser's own text escaper, so it leaves " and '
// alone. The live repo settled the reachability question on hardware that this
// port could not reach - `/interface/bridge/add name="qt\"test"` is accepted on
// a hAP ac2 running RouterOS 7.24 and the API returns the raw quote - so
// `ether1" onmouseover="x` closes this attribute and opens another. Whoever can
// name an interface can inject one. This card was held back until that fix
// landed rather than ported with the quirk reproduced.
